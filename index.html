    <h1>Udemy Complete JavaScript Course</h1>
    <p>
      This course was divided into sections, each focused on teaching a specific
      JavaScript concept through a lecture and an assignment. In the
      assignments, I wrote code to accomplish a particular goal using the
      knowledge from the lecture, followed by guidance on how the code should
      ideally be written. The HTML and CSS in the provided links were supplied
      by the course, and I developed the functionality using JavaScript based on
      a design spec. Most course sections didn't include a web interface;
      instead, they involved writing JavaScript code directly in the browser's
      console, so a web interface isn't shown for those sections.
